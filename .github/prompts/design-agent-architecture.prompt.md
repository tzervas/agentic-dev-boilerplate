# Design Agent Architecture Prompt

## Task
Design a scalable, modular architecture for an AI agent system that can handle multiple concurrent tasks, integrate with various AI models, and maintain security and performance.

## Requirements
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Support for multiple AI frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Secure API integrations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Scalable to handle increased load

## Deliverables
- Architecture diagram (text-based)
- Component descriptions
- Data flow explanations
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization strategies

## Constraints
- Must be language-agnostic where possible
- Follow best practices for AI agent development
- Ensure extensibility for future features
