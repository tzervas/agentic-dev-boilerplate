# Agentic Dev Boilerplate

A comprehensive template system for generating agentic development workflows and automation infrastructure.

**Version**: 1.1.2  
**Repository**: https://github.com/tzervas/agentic-dev-boilerplate

## Overview

This project provides a complete foundation for building agentic development systems with automated multi-agent coordination, intelligent task tracking, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines. It includes specialized agents for planning, testing, debugging, deployment, and system engineering, all working together to streamline development workflows.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### From PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install agentic-dev-boilerplate
```

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tzervas/agentic-dev-boilerplate
cd agentic-dev-boilerplate
pip install -e .
```

### Generate Boilerplate

Create a new project with the CLI:

```bash
# Generate boilerplate for your project
agentic-dev-boilerplate --schema project-schema.yaml --output ./my-project

# Or use short options
agentic-dev-boilerplate -s my-schema.yaml -o ./my-project
```

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.11 or later
- **Git** 2.30+ (for version control)
- **GPG** (for commit signing)

## Development Setup

1. **Install UV (fast Python package manager)**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tzervas/agentic-dev-boilerplate
   cd agentic-dev-boilerplate
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Configure Git**
   ```bash
   python scripts/git_setup.py --setup
   ```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

Run the complete validation suite:

```bash
./test-package.sh
```

### Docker Testing

For isolated testing and validation:

```bash
# Build and run tests
docker-compose up --build

# Or build and test manually
docker build -t agentic-boilerplate-test .
docker run --rm agentic-boilerplate-test
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Task Planning
Use the planner agent to break down features and create implementation roadmaps. Tasks are tracked in `tasking/tracker.yaml` with context files stored in `tasking/context/`.

### 2. Implementation
- Create feature branches: `git checkout -b feature/task-name`
- Implement changes following project standards
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

### 3. Testing & Validation
```bash
# Run validation suite
python scripts/validation_scripts.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

### 4. Create Pull Request
```bash
# Create PR with automation
python scripts/create_pr_local.py

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh pr create --fill
```

### 5. Code Review
Pull requests are automatically enriched with labels and milestones. Validation runs automatically on PR events to ensure code quality and standards compliance.

## Multi-Agent Coordination

The system supports collaborative problem-solving through coordinated multi-agent workflows.

### Starting Multi-Agent Sessions
```bash
# Solve complex problems with multiple agents
python scripts/multi_agent_solver.py \
  --problem "Implement user authentication system" \
  --agents planner tester debugger deployer \
  --consensus-threshold 0.8
```

### Agent Coordination Features
- **Orchestrated Problem Decomposition**: Complex tasks are automatically broken down into manageable components
- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Solutions are validated by multiple specialized agents
- **Consensus Building**: Team agreement on optimal approaches and solutions
- **Collaborative Tracking**: Shared progress monitoring and status updates
- **Coordinated Execution**: Synchronized implementation across all participating agents

### Available Agents

- **Planner**: Task decomposition, roadmap generation, and agent routing
- **Tester**: Validation suites, test execution, and result analysis
- **Debugger**: Root cause analysis, log processing, and patch development
- **Deployer**: Production deployment, rollback orchestration, and change management
- **Systems Engineer**: Hardware emulation, IOMMU/VFIO configuration, and GPU passthrough
- **DevOps Specialist**: Infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and network orchestration
- **Orchestrator**: Multi-agent coordination, collaborative problem-solving, and team consensus
- **Software Engineer**: Code implementation, refactoring, and architecture design
- **AI Engineer**: ML model development, AI integration, and data pipeline optimization

### GitHub Integration
Label issues or pull requests to trigger multi-agent coordination:
- `testing` → Involves tester agent
- `debug` → Involves debugger agent
- `deploy` → Involves deployer agent
- `infra` → Involves systems engineer and DevOps specialist
